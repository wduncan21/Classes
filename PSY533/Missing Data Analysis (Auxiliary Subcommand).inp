TITLE:
Maximum Likelihood Estimation with Auxiliary Variables
Only Manifest Variables (No Latent Variables)
AUXILIARY Subcommand

DATA:
! Read in the raw data.
file = example.dat;

VARIABLE:
names = efficacy bmi distance bodyfat;
! Select the variables used in the analysis.  Omit the auxiliary variables
! from the USEVARIABLES subcommand.
usevariables = efficacy bmi;
! Incorporate auxiliary variables using the saturated correlates model.
auxiliary = (m) distance bodyfat;
! Specify the missing value code.
missing = all(-99);

ANALYSIS:
! Specify full information maximum likelihood estimation.
estimator = ml;

MODEL:
bmi on efficacy;
! Estimate the variances and covariances between the incomplete exogenous
! variables (which is not applicable here because self-efficacy is complete)
! to apply distributional assumptions to the incomplete exogenous variables.

OUTPUT:
standardized (stdyx);
